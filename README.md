# Strapi Angular Blog Backend

An instance of Strapi applied to a simple Blog structure.

## Objective

The objective of this project is showing how to connect an Angular Application to Strapi Headless CMS (strapi.io). This has a configured Strapi, which means that basically I've installed it, created 2 entities (category and posts) and authorized access to the generated API openly.

## Use case
Consider that someone needs to use Strapi as CMS for a journal/blog. The project was created for 2 entities only: Category and Posts.

## References
I've used two templates from bootstrap website to create the HTMLs.

## Structure

Its basically Strapi, but in the API folder you can find 2 entities: Category and Post, with all its controllers, models and so on.
